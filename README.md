**Python Coding Assessment**

_Instructions:_

-   This assessment is designed to evaluate your understanding of fundamental Python concepts.
-   You are required to complete the tasks outlined below within the specified time frame.
-   Ensure your code adheres to Python syntax and best practices.
-   Write comments to explain your code where necessary.
-   Create a well-written  **README**  file providing instructions on repository setup and running the application in the terminal.
-   Create a new  **PRIVATE**  repository, and push your solutions to it.

**Topics Covered:**

1.  Basic data structures
2.  Functions
3.  Decorators
4.  Sequences
5.  Sets, Dictionaries
6.  Object-Oriented Programming

**Tasks:**

1.  **Function:  `add_numbers`  (2 points)**
    
    -   Write a Python function named  `add_numbers`  that takes two parameters  `num1`  and  `num2`, and returns the sum of the two numbers.
2.  **Function:  `is_even`  (2 points)**
    
    -   Write a Python function named  `is_even`  that takes a single parameter  `number`  and returns  `True`  if the number is even, and  `False`  otherwise.
3.  **Function:  `reverse_string`  (2 points)**
    
    -   Write a Python function named  `reverse_string`  that takes a string  `text`  as input and returns the reversed version of that string.
4.  **Function:  `count_vowels`  (2 points)**
    
    -   Write a Python function named  `count_vowels`  that takes a string  `text`  as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity.
5.  **Function:  `calculate_factorial`  (2 points)**
    
    -   Write a Python function named  `calculate_factorial`  that takes a non-negative integer  `n`  as input and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
6.  **Function:  `apply_decorator`  (1 point)**
    
    -   Write a Python function named  `apply_decorator`  that takes a function  `func`  as input and applies a decorator named  `decorator_func`. The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.
7.  **Sequences: Sort List of Tuples (1 point)**
    
    -   Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and an age, write a Python function named  `sort_by_age`  that sorts the list of tuples by age in ascending order.
8.  **Sets and Dictionaries: Merge Dictionaries (1 point)**
    
    -   Write a Python function named  `merge_dicts`  that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any common keys, their values should be summed up.
9.  **Object-Oriented Programming: Class Creation (2 points)**
    
    -   Define a Python class named  `Car`  with the following attributes:  `make`,  `model`,  `year`. Implement a method named  `display_info`  that prints out the car's information.

**Submission:**

-   Submit your GitHub repository that contains your solution to the assessment.
-   Ensure your code runs correctly and efficiently.
-   Create a README file with clear instructions on repository setup and running the application in the terminal.
